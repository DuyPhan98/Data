### The framework aims to:
- To develop a reliable ML model capable of predicting strain capacity and crack spacing of SH-FRCCs with experimental validation.
- To determine the effects of input parameters on both strain capacity and crack spacing of SH-FRCCs using SHAP and PDP.
- To experimentally validate the developed ML mode.
